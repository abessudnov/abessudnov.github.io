I am a quantitative social scientist at the University of Exeter. I study ethnic groups and inequalities in education, in Russia and in the UK.

Recently completed and ongoing projects:

**1. Ethnic and regional inequalities in the Russian military fatalities in the war in Ukraine.**

I use a crowdsourced data set on the Russian military fatalities in Ukraine to analyse how the fatality rates varied by ethnicity and region.

**2. Predicting perceived ethnicity with data on personal names in Russia.**

VK, the largest Russian social media website, provides an API that can be used for downloading data for social research. However, VK does not record users' ethnicity. In a recent working paper we developed an ML-based method to code perceived ethnicity with the data on personal names collected on VK.

**3. Ethnic intermarriage in Russia.**

With Christiaan Monden we used data from the Russian census to look at ethnic intermarriage in Russia across several cohorts and cities.
