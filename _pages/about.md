I am a quantitative social scientist at the University of Exeter. I study immigration, ethnic groups and inequalities in education, in Russia and in the UK, using statistical analysis of survey, administrative, social media and experimental data.

I am also a deputy head of the Department of Social and Political Sciences, Philosophy and Anthropology in Exeter.

Recently completed papers:

**1. Using digital trace data in Russian studies.**

This is a review of the literature that used digital trace data to study political communication, education, labour markets in Russia, as well as the Russo-Ukrainian war and its consequences, in the context when traditional data collection has become more difficult.

**2. Russian military fatalities in Ukraine.**

We used the official Russian mortality statistics to estimate excess male mortality in 2022-23 due to the Russo-Ukrainian war. The number of Russian fatalities in 2022-23 was about 60,000: a very significant death toll but lower than sometimes reported in the media.

**3. Ethnic and regional inequalities in the Russian military fatalities in the war in Ukraine.**

I used a crowdsourced data set on the Russian military fatalities in Ukraine to analyse how the fatality rates varied by ethnicity and region. To do this, I applied a machine learning classifier to infer perceived ethnicity from personal names.
