I am a quantitative social scientist at the University of Exeter. I am mostly interested in ethnic inequalities and inequalities in education and conduct research both on Russia and the UK.

**My office hours for Term 2 in 2019-20: Monday, 10-11am; Friday, 10-11am (Clayden 1.05)**

Recently completed projects:

**1. Ethnic intermarriage in Russia.**

With Christiaan Monden we used data from the Russian census to look at ethnic intermarriage in Russia across several cohorts and cities.

**2. Ethnic hierarchy in the Russian labour market.**

Together with Andrey Shcherbak from the HSE St Petersburg we conducted the first audit study of ethnic discrimination in the Russian labour market. We have sent over 9,000 job applications in four Russian cities to explore the differences in response rates across 10 ethnic groups. The project has been supported by the British Academy and the HSE as part of the International Mobility and Partnership scheme.

**3. The effect of academisation on educational trajectories of children with special needs in England.**

Together with Alison Black, Brahm Norwich and Yi Liu we analysed data from the National Pupil Database to estimate the effect of converting English schools to academies on children with special educational needs. The project has been funded by the ESRC's Secondary Data Analysis Initiative.
